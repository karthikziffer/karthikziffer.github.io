In this blog post, I‚Äôm sharing my journey of installing Seldon Core from scratch on my Mac. I started by setting up a local Kubernetes cluster and installing all the necessary dependencies, then tested everything with a scikit-learn Iris classification model. Although I followed the official guide, I ran into a few bumps along the way.

Initially, I tried deploying Seldon Core using the Ambassador gateway, but that approach kept giving me trouble. Instead, I switched to Istio as my ingress gateway, which ended up working much better. In this guide, I‚Äôll walk you through the steps I took to install Seldon Core with Istio, along with some troubleshooting tips for the issues I encountered.

I hope this guide helps anyone looking to set up Seldon Core locally!





#### 1. Create a Kubernetes cluster

```
kind create cluster --name seldon --image kindest/node:v1.24.7
```

```
Creating cluster "seldon" ...
 ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.24.7) üñº 
 ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶  
 ‚úì Writing configuration üìú 
 ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è 
 ‚úì Installing CNI üîå 
 ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ 
Set kubectl context to "kind-seldon"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-seldon

Thanks for using kind! üòä
```



```
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-seldon
```

```

Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:57701
CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:57701/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

```

#### 2. Istio-system

It manages the control plane components (such as the Istio ingress gateway, Pilot, Mixer, etc.). It keeps all Istio-related resources organized and separated from your application namespaces.

```
kubectl get svc -n istio-system
No resources found in istio-system namespace.

```



Istio installation

```
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -

add the /Users/karthikrajedran/Documents/seldon-core/istio-1.25.0/bin directory to your environment path variable with:
	 export PATH="$PATH:/Users/karthikrajedran/Documents/seldon-core/istio-1.25.0/bin"

Begin the Istio pre-installation check by running:
	 istioctl x precheck 

Try Istio in ambient mode

After istio installation, update the istio folder's bin directory to the beginning of the list of places your system searches for commands.

```
cd istio-1.25.0

export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH

istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
```

```

The Kubernetes version v1.24.7 is not supported by Istio 1.25.0. The minimum supported Kubernetes version is 1.28.
Proceeding with the installation, but you might experience problems. See https://istio.io/latest/docs/releases/supported-releases/ for a list of supported versions.

#### 3. Seldon-core installation using helm chart

Helm chart is used to simplify deployments, keep track of the deployed version and can be easily shared through repositories. 

```
helm install seldon-core seldon-core-operator \
    --repo https://storage.googleapis.com/seldon-charts \
    --set usageMetrics.enabled=true \
    --set istio.enabled=true \
    --namespace seldon-system

```



```
kubectl get pods -n seldon-system

seldon-controller-manager-55654bbdf6-fbmmr   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          6s

```
kubectl get svc -n istio-system

kubectl get pods -n seldon-system

```
kubectl port-forward -n istio-system svc/istio-ingressgateway 8080:80

The seldon core installation is completed. 

I would recommend to use the configurations in an .yaml file rather than directly pasting it on the command line. Yaml file keeps the indentation intact, this will avoid indentation errors. 



#### 4. Sample Machine learning trained model inference

Seldon Core lets you run predictions on your trained models using a simple API. It works with many model types‚Äîincluding computer vision and Hugging Face models‚Äîand you can make predictions using either REST or gRPC calls.

```
kubectl apply -f - << END                                                  
apiVersion: machinelearning.seldon.io/v1
kind: SeldonDeployment
metadata:
  name: iris-model
  namespace: seldon
spec:
  name: iris
  predictors:
  - graph:
      implementation: SKLEARN_SERVER
      modelUri: gs://seldon-models/v1.19.0-dev/sklearn/iris
      name: classifier
    name: default
    replicas: 1
END

seldondeployment.machinelearning.seldon.io/iris-model created

```



```

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/seldon/seldon/iris-model/api/v1.0/predictions \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{ "data": { "ndarray": [[1,2,3,4]] } }'

```

 Inference Output

```    

{"data":{"names":["t:0","t:1","t:2"],"ndarray":[[0.0006985194531162853,0.003668039039435755,0.9956334415074478]]},"meta":{"requestPath":{"classifier":"seldonio/sklearnserver:1.17.1"}}}

```





In this blog post, I set up a workflow with Seldon Core to run machine learning model predictions at a large scale. Using Kubernetes gives us a big advantage‚Äîmanaging and scaling ML inference becomes much easier. With tools like HPA and KEDA, the system can automatically adjust to the amount of traffic, helping to control infrastructure costs.

Seldon Core also provides a full set of machine learning operations tools, including observability, explainers, and more. The only challenge is managing the Kubernetes infrastructure. If your organization is comfortable with Kubernetes and has a team to manage it, Seldon Core is a great choice for scalable ML inference.

In future posts, I‚Äôll dive deeper into using Seldon Core for computer vision tasks and compare it with other platforms like Kubeflow.
